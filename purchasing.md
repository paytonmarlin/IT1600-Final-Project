# Purchasing Your PC Parts!

#### Let's break the parts down one by one so that it's your choice as to what you end up buying!

1. CPU
 - Yes, you read that correctly, we are beginning with the CPU. The CPU that you choose will have an impact on every other part in your build. Luckily, you have plenty of options. There are 2 CPU brands, AMD and Intel. As of writing this in July of 2020, AMD is currently the best price-to-performance choice, which is why I will be recommending that you purchase an AMD CPU.
 - Choosing a CPU truly depends on what you plan on doing with the system. For the everyday user doing basic web browsing and document editing, an AMD Ryzen 3 3200G processor will do the job. However, if you plan on doing more intensive workloads like gaming, streaming, or video editing, you'll need to go for a beefier selection. I would recommend that you go for a Ryzen 5 3600 (6 cores) or Ryzen 7 3700X (8 cores).

2. Motherboard
 - Now that you have made your selection for the CPU, it's time to choose a Motherboard. If you went for one of the lower end CPUs, you can also go for one of the lower end motherboards. A B450 motherboard on the lower end of the price range will work just fine with your new CPU. If you went for the Ryzen 5, I would recommend a B450 or B550 motherboard in the $100-$200 range. The main difference between B450 and B550 is lifespan of the chipset. AMD recently announced B550, so you can bet that it will be supported for longer than B450, as AMD had actually announced that it would not support B450 boards on their newest lineup of chips expected to drop in late 2020. A B550 is as sure bet that will have a clear upgrade path multiple years into the future. If you went for the Ryzen 5, 7, or 9, there is also nothing wrong with going for an X570 board, but those can get pricey. One thing to look for when you are purchasing a motherboard is the maximum memory allowed as well as how many M.2 slots it has for NVME M.2 storage.

3. RAM
 - For a Ryzen CPU, I would advise against choosing a memory speed slower than 3200. The performance of the Ryzen CPUs increases with high speed memory. If you can find a 3200 or 3600 kit, you will be set. I would recommend going with a 16 GB kit.

4. Storage
 - In the last 5 years, the prices of SSD (solid state drive) storage has significantly decreased. There is also a new technology called NVME which is in M.2 SSDs, which can be attached directly to the motherboard. If the motherboard you chose has an M.2 slot, I would recommend purchasing an M.2 drive. If not, go for a SSD with a SATA connection. If you need mass storage, then you can also look into HDDs (hard disk drive). For the average person, I would recommend against them.

5. GPU
 - If you plan on using this computer for gaming or editing, you will want to purchase a GPU. Also, if you went with something other than the 3200G, you will need to buy one since none of the other CPUs recommended in this guide come with onboard graphics. If this is you, then I would recommend something along the lines of the GT 730.
 - Now, for the rest of you that ended up building this PC for something more strenuous: this is where you are going to spend the most money in this build. If you want to go all out, the NVIDIA RTX 2080 Super is the card for you. Otherwise, I would recommend the AMD RX 5700XT or the NVIDIA 2070 Super. The 5700XT and 2070 Super both are cards designed to get extreme 1080p performance, as well as acceptable performance at 1440p. The 2080 super is designed to be used with 1440p or 4K.

6. PSU
 - Now that you have picked out most of the parts, you need something to power your system. It's important to wait to purchase the power supply until you have picked out the rest of your parts so that you make sure you buy one that can supply enough power to everything in your system. If you are building our entry level PC, a 500W power supply should be fine. Otherwise, I would recommend going for something in the 750W range. It's important to make sure that you buy from a reputable brand such as Corsair, EVGA, SeaSonic, or Cooler Master, to name a few. Also make sure that your PSU is at least 80 PLUS Bronze rated (the scale goes White, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum). This ensures that your power supply has been certified as efficient, which typically leads to a safer experience as well as a longer life cycle.

7. Case
 - We leave the case for last to make sure that it can fit everything that we selected. The size case you buy depends on the size motherboard. Micro-ATX motherboards can fit into a Micro-ATX sized case or bigger, while an ATX motherboard cannot fit into a Micro-ATX and must be placed into an ATX case. Regardless of what you went for, I would recommend looking for a mid-tower, ATX sized case, as it will leave you room to upgrade parts in the future without the need for purchasing another case. I'll leave a couple of recommendations as well as all of the other options on Newegg.
